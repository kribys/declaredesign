An attempt to use the DeclareDesign package to describe the research design by [Moxnes et al](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/3874/history/41807). The three-armed parallell randomized control trial is simulated in order to better understand the properties of the trial, based on the MIDA-framework for describing designs.
